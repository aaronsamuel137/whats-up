		<p id="about">What's Up is a web-based application that finds current events on Twitter. The app scans streaming tweets and find patterns in order to identify currently happening topics and events in real time. Users can see the most recent tweets in general, or search for a specific topic and see a sample of the most recent tweets relevant to that topic. The app also provides visualizations showing sentiments (positive or negative) about topics users search for based on tweet content. </p>
